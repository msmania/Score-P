/**
 * @section advice_substrate_plugins Advice for developers
 * The developer of a substrate plugin should provide a README file which
 * explains how to compile, install and use the plugin. In particular,
 * the supported substrates should be described in the README file.
 *
 * Each substrate plugin has to include <tt>SCOREP_SubstratePlugins.h</tt>
 * and implement a 'get_info' function. Therefore, use the
 * #SCOREP_SUBSTRATE_PLUGIN_ENTRY macro and provide the name of the plugin
 * library as the argument.
 * The plugin library must be called libscorep_substrate_<libraryname>.so
 * For example, the example substrate plugin libscorep_substrate_example.so should use
 * #SCOREP_SUBSTRATE_PLUGIN_ENTRY( example ).
 * Substrate plugins that implement event functions should also include
 * <tt>SCOREP_SubstrateEvents.h</tt>
 * Plugin writers should also refer to
 * <tt>SCOREP_PublicHandles.h</tt> and <tt>SCOREP_PublicTypes.h</tt>
 * to handle SCOREP handles given in event functions.
 *
 * @section funcs Functions
 * See each function for details.
 * All functions except init are optional!
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::init "init"
 *
 * Check requirements and initialize the plugin.
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::assign_id "assign_id"
 *
 * The plugin gets an id that can be used later to store location specific data.
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::init_mpp "init_mpp"
 *
 * If an MPP paradigm is used, it will be initialized when this call occurs.
 * If no MPP paradigm is used, this function will be called as well.
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::finalize "finalize"
 *
 * Finalization of Score-P.
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::create_location "create_location"
 *
 * Create a new location (e.g., when a thread is created)
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::delete_location "delete_location"
 *
 * Delete an existing location
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::activate_cpu_location "activate_cpu_location"
 *
 * Activate a CPU location to write events. Called, for example, after create_location on CPU locations.
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::deactivate_cpu_location "deactivate_cpu_location"
 *
 * Deactivate a CPU location. Called, for example, before delete_location.
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::pre_unify "pre_unify"
 *
 * Called before the unify step, after the measurement.
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::write_data "write_data"
 *
 * Called after the measurement when writing data.
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::core_task_create "core_task_create"
 *
 * Create a task (e.g., an OpenMP task)
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::core_task_complete "core_task_complete"
 *
 * Complete a task (e.g., an OpenMP task)
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::new_definition_handle "new_definition_handle"
 *
 * Called when a handle is defined, which could define, for example a region or a metric. Plugins can use callbacks to get meta data for this handle.
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::get_event_functions "get_event_functions"
 *
 * Called twice with different modes. Get a list of events that shall be passed to the plugin.
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::set_callbacks "set_callbacks"
 *
 * Called before get_event_functions. Set a list of callbacks so that the plugin can get meta data for handles.
 *
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::undeclared "undeclared"
 *
 * MUST be set to zero. Added for extendability.
 *
 * @section variables Mandatory variable
 * @ref SCOREP_SubstratePluginInfo::plugin_version "plugin_version"
 *
 * Must be set to SCOREP_SUBSTRATE_PLUGIN_VERSION
