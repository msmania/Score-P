/**
 * Helper to define the communication locations for an paradigm.
 *
 * This helper can be used by single process paradigms, which need to
 * declare its communication group when it is used in an multi process
 * paradigm. Each rank has its own list of locations, which will be
 * collected at the root rank, where the group definition is triggered
 * into the definition manager by rank 0. It returns the offset of this rank
 * into the collated list of locations. This function is best called in a
 * pre_unify subsystem hook and not later. The paradigm must ensure that
 * no previous Group definition is triggered before this call.
