/**
 * @file
 *
 * @brief Interface called by the measurement core to construct the profile.
 *
 * The profile is created with the following structure:
 * For each location a node of type @ref scorep_profile_node_thread_root is created which
 * are linked together as siblings. The children of the @ref scorep_profile_node_thread_root
 * nodes are of type @ref scorep_profile_node_thread_start and represent each an activation
 * (start of a parallel region in OpenMP). In the initial thread one
 * @ref scorep_profile_node_thread_start node is created, too. They contain informatation
 * from which callpath they are created. Their children are the region or parameter
 * nodes called from within the parallel region.
 *
 * Whenever a region is entered, a child of the node representing the current callpath
 * is created, if it does not already exist. If a parameter is triggered a new node
 * for this parameter value is created if it does not already exists.
 *
 * During post-processing the structure of the profile altered. First the nodes of
 * type @scorep_profile_node_thread_start are expanded, so that for each thread the full
 * calltree appears below its root node.
