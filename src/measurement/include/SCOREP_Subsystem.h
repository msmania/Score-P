 * @defgroup SCOREP_Subsystem SCOREP Subsystem Management

 * Subsystem Management will be handled by callback functions, which will be
   called at defined places from the measurement system. In the particular
   callbacks the subsystem is only allowed to make specific actions.

 * Each subsystem exports these callbacks in a object of type @ref SCOREP_Subsystem
   which is described in this module.

 * @ref SCOREP_Subsystem objects are referenced by an array inside the
   measurement system, so the measurement system does not need to know
   explicitly which subsystems are included at compile time.
