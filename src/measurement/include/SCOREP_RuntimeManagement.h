 * Before the adapters can use the @ref SCOREP_Definitions definitions interface
 * and the @ref SCOREP_Events event interface the measurement system needs to be
 * initialized. Therefore we require that one (arbitrary) adapter calls
 * SCOREP_InitMeasurement(). There the initialization of all adapter in use is
 * triggered. Adapters may also explicitly finalize the measurement system by
 * calling SCOREP_FinalizeMeasurement() which is usually implicitly done. During
 * measurement the recording of events can be dis- or enabled (see the todos).
 *
 * @todo SCOREP_EnableRecording() and SCOREP_DisableRecording(). Specify what will
 * happen internally. Will the dis/enabling be proccess-wise or will there be
 * a global synchronization (if possible from inside the measurement). Global
 * synchronization can be demanded from the user. Process-local dis/enabling
 * will render the traces useless for Scalasca analysis.
