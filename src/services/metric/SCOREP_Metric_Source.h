     * There are three different functions used for reading metric values:
     * @ metric_source_strictly_synchronous_read, @ metric_source_synchronous_read,
     * and @ metric_source_asynchronous_read.
     *
     * @ metric_source_strictly_synchronous_read is used to read values
     * of strictly synchronous metrics. Strictly synchronous metrics are
     * recorded at every function enter/exit event and have to provide
     * a metric value. This function gets an array as argument to which
     * values are written. Each metric of the requested event set
     * @ eventSet must write exactely one value at its corresponding
     * position within the value array (e.g. metric i writes its value
     * in @ values[i]).
     *
     * @ metric_source_synchronous_read is used tio read values of
     * synchronous metrics (note the missing 'strictly'). In contrast
     * to @ metric_source_strictly_synchronous_read it is allowed to
     * skip writting of specific metric values. Therefore, @ is_updated
     * is used to indicate whether a value was written for a metric or
     * not. For example, if a new value of metric i should be written,
     * its value is stored in @ values[i] and @ is_updated[i] is set to
     * true. Otherwise @ is_updated[i] is set to false and @ value[i] do
     * not have to be touched.
     *
     * @ metric_source_asynchronous_read is used to read values
     * of asynchronous metrics. Asynchronous metrics can be measured at
     * function enter/leave events but also at arbitrary points in time.
     * Each time a asynchronous metric is called to write its values,
     * the has to provide an arbitrary count of timestamp-value-pairs.
     * For example, mettic i of event set @ eventSet write its
     * timestamp-values-pairs in @ timevalue_pointer[i]. In addition,
     * metric i has to store the number of written timestamp-values-
     * pairs in @ num-pairs[i].
