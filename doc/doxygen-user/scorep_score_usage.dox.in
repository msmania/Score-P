Usage: scorep-score [options] <profile>
Options:
 -r          Show all regions.
 -h, --help  Show this help and exit.
 -f <filter> Shows the result with the filter applied.
 -c <num>    Specifies the number of hardware counters that shall be measured.
             By default, this value is 0, which means that only a timestamp
             is measured on each event. If you plan to record hardware counters
             specify the number of hardware counters. Otherwise, scorep-score
             may underestimate the required space.
 -m          Prints mangled region names instead of demangled names.
 -s <choice> Sorting of entries. Possible choices are totaltime, timepervisit,
              maxbuffer, visits and name (default=maxbuffer).
 -g [<list>] Generation of an initial filter file with the name
             'initial_scorep.filter'. A valid parameter list has the form
             KEY=VALUE[,KEY=VALUE]*. By default, uses the following control
             parameters:

                 `bufferpercent=1,timepervisit=1`

             A region is included in the filter file (i.e., excluded from
             measurement) if it matches all of the given conditions, with the
             following keys:
             - `bufferpercent`       : estimated memory requirements exceed the
                                       given threshold in percent of the total
                                       estimated trace buffer requirements
             - `bufferabsolute`      : estimated memory requirements exceed
                                       the given absolute threshold in MB
             - `visits`              : number of visits exceeds the given
                                       threshold
             - `timepervisit`        : time per visit value is below the given
                                       threshold in microseconds
             - `type`                : region type matches the given value
                                       (allowed: 'usr', 'com', 'both')
