Specify package and library interface version here. The package version has
merely marketing character and is the version encoded in the tarball. Much
more important is the library interface version as it is crucial for dynamic
(re)linking. Please CAREFULLY READ following documents before adjusting the
library interface version:

    https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/libtool.html#Versioning
    http://sourceware.org/autobook/autobook/autobook_91.html#SEC91

package.major=2
package.minor=0
package.bugfix=8
package.suffix=

# In the POMP2 case library.revision makes no sense as opari2 just provides
# the interface definition and no (installed) implementation. So, set
# library.revision always to 0 and ignore it for version compatibility checks.
library.current=3
library.revision=0
library.age=0
