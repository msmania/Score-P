                             ========================

Cube Library is a general purpose library for reading and writing of a multi-
dimensional performance space consisting of the dimensions (i) performance
metric, (ii) call path, and (iii) system resource. Each dimension can be
represented as a tree, where non-leaf nodes of the tree can be collapsed or
expanded to achieve the desired level of granularity.

The Cube Library is a general purpose library, optimized in first place to be
used with Cube GUI, but might get used in another tools as well.

Cube Library is released as open source under a BSD-style license.
Please see the COPYING file in the package base directory for details.
