                        ========================
                           (Status:  Nov 2022)

This file lists known limitations and unimplemented features of Cube
Library.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Platform support

  - Cube Library has been tested on the following platforms:
    + IBM Blue Gene/Q
    + IBM BladeCenter & iDataPlex clusters
    + Cray XC series
    + Fujitsu FX10, FX100, and K computer
    + various Linux-based clusters (x86_64, Power8, armhf, AArch64)
    + Intel Xeon Phi (native mode only)

    In addition, the provided configure options (see INSTALL) may provide a
    good basis for building and testing the toolset on other systems.  Please
    report success/failure on other platforms to the Cube Library
    development team.

  - The following platforms have not been tested recently, however, the
    supplied build system might still work on those systems:
     + IBM Blue Gene/P
     + AIX-based clusters (Power6)
     + Cray XT, XE, XK series
     + Oracle/Sun Solaris/SPARC-based clusters

  - On the Intel Xeon Phi platform, only Intel compilers and Intel MPI are
    currently supported.
